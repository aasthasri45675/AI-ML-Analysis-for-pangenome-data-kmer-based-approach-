#A k-mer based framework for pangenome analysis and identification of mobile genetic element associated variation in Salmonella entrica.

## Description 
This projects analyze pangenomes of salmonella and identifies MGE using k-mer counts.

## Requriments
-python 3.11
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-scikit-learn

# kmer Extraction and frequency profiling.
Whole genomic Sequence of Salmonella entrica including chromosome,phage and plasmid has been used in this project. The genomic sequence of kmer-21 has been choosen on the basis of data profiling.
